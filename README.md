<!-- We have done:

```
# runtime : compare between bruteforce and infomads
# online: our algorithm vs existing work
# offline: our algorithm vs bruteforce
``` -->
## Run Our Program

### Setup
**You have `uv`.** To run our program, we recommend to have uv installed (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), as then you automatically have the same packages and python version.

**You prefer to use another tool**. We provide a requirements.txt file, which ensures that we have the same packages installed. Note that we developped our code using Python 3.9.

### Run

Execute our program using
```
uv run main.py args
```

TODO: add the possibility of reading a txt file.
